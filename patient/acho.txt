The patient is a 2-year-old male presenting with disproportionate short stature. He has markedly short limbs, especially the proximal segments (rhizomelia), and a relatively large head with frontal bossing and midface hypoplasia. There is a flattened nasal bridge and trident-shaped hands. Growth parameters are below the 3rd percentile for height, while weight is near average. The patient’s developmental milestones are normal. There is a family history of short stature, but no other known skeletal dysplasia. No significant neurological, cardiac, or renal abnormalities are reported.
