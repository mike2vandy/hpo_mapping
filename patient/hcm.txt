The patient is a young adult who presented with exertional dyspnea, reduced exercise tolerance, and episodic chest pain that worsens with physical activity. They report palpitations and have experienced near-syncope during exertion. There is a family history of sudden cardiac death in a first-degree relative at a young age.

Physical examination reveals a harsh systolic ejection murmur best heard along the left sternal border, which increases with Valsalva maneuver. Blood pressure is normal at rest.

Electrocardiogram demonstrates left ventricular hypertrophy with abnormal Q waves and repolarization abnormalities. Transthoracic echocardiography shows asymmetric septal hypertrophy, with marked thickening of the interventricular septum, preserved left ventricular systolic function, and left ventricular outflow tract obstruction at rest. Doppler imaging reveals systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve and mitral regurgitation.

Cardiac MRI confirms myocardial hypertrophy and demonstrates patchy late gadolinium enhancement, consistent with myocardial fibrosis. Ambulatory rhythm monitoring identifies episodes of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia.
